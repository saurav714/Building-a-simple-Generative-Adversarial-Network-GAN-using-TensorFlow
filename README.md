**GANs in TensorFlow (Google Colab)**

This project implements a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow, inspired by the DigitalOcean tutorial. The GAN is trained to generate handwritten digit images using the MNIST dataset. All code runs smoothly in Google Colab with GPU acceleration.

🚀 Features

Dataset: MNIST (28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits)

Generator:

Input: 100-dimensional random noise vector

Output: 784-dimensional vector reshaped to a 28x28 image

Discriminator:

Input: 784-dimensional image

Output: Probability of the image being real

Training Strategy:

Binary cross-entropy loss

Optimized with Adam (learning rate = 0.0001)

Alternating training between Generator and Discriminator

Visualization:

Generates and saves a 4×4 grid of sample images after every epoch

📋 Prerequisites
Google Colab comes with required libraries, but ensure the following are available:

bash
Copy
Edit
!pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
🧪 Setup Instructions (Google Colab)
Open Colab: Go to Google Colab

Create Notebook: Click File → New Notebook

Install Dependencies (if not already installed):

python
Copy
Edit
!pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Upload Code:

Paste the code from main.py into a cell, or

Use the "Files" tab → "Upload" to add main.py

Optional: Mount Google Drive for persistent storage:

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Clone GitHub Repo (optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
!git config --global user.name "your-username"
!git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
!git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
💡 Usage
Run Training:

Train for 50 epochs (default)

View saved images like image_at_epoch_0001.png

View Outputs:

Check images in the "Files" tab or saved Google Drive directory

Losses for both Generator and Discriminator printed per epoch

Save & Push to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
%cd /content/your-repo-name
!cp /content/image_at_epoch_*.png .
!git add .
!git commit -m "Add GAN code and generated images from Colab"
!git push origin main

🧠 How It Works
Data Preprocessing:

Load and normalize MNIST images to [-1, 1]

Flatten 28x28 images to 784D vectors

Generator Architecture:

css
Copy
Edit
Input: 100D noise vector
→ Dense(256) → LeakyReLU
→ Dense(512) → LeakyReLU
→ Dense(784, activation='tanh')
Discriminator Architecture:

css
Copy
Edit
Input: 784D image
→ Dense(512) → LeakyReLU
→ Dense(256) → LeakyReLU
→ Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
Training Strategy:

Discriminator learns to classify real vs fake

Generator improves to fool the Discriminator

Alternates training both models using binary cross-entropy loss

⚙️ Colab Tips
Enable GPU:

Go to Runtime → Change runtime type → Select "GPU"

Stability Tips:

GANs can be unstable. Tune learning rates, batch size, or architecture if needed.

Storage:

Colab resets file storage on runtime end—save to Google Drive to persist.
