GANs in TensorFlow Project (Google Colab)
Overview
This project implements a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow, inspired by the DigitalOcean tutorial "Implementing GANs in TensorFlow" (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/implementing-gans-in-tensorflow). It trains a Generator to create fake handwritten digit images and a Discriminator to distinguish real images (from the MNIST dataset) from fakes, all runnable in Google Colab.
Features

Dataset: Uses the MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale handwritten digits.
Models:
Generator: Takes random noise (100D vector) and generates 784D vectors (flattened 28x28 images).
Discriminator: Classifies images as real or fake with a probability output.


Training: Alternates between training the Discriminator and Generator using binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizers.
Visualization: Generates and saves a 4x4 grid of sample images after each epoch.

Prerequisites

Google Colab: A free cloud-based Python environment with GPU support.
Libraries (pre-installed in Colab, but verified in code):
TensorFlow (2.x)
NumPy
Matplotlib


GitHub: An account to upload the project.

Setup in Google Colab

Open Google Colab:
Go to Google Colab.
Create a new notebook: Click "File" → "New Notebook".


Install Dependencies:
Colab typically includes TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Verify and install if needed by adding this cell:!pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib




Upload or Write Code:
Copy the code from main.py (or the tutorial) into a Colab cell.
Alternatively, upload the script:
Click "File" → "Upload Notebook" or use the "Files" tab to upload main.py.




Connect to GitHub:
Mount Google Drive (optional, for saving files):from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


Authenticate GitHub:!git config --global user.name "your-username"
!git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
!git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git





Usage

Run the Code in Colab:
Add the GAN code to a cell (or run main.py):
Load MNIST, define models, train, and generate images.


Execute cells by clicking the "Run" button or pressing Shift + Enter.
Training runs for 50 epochs by default, saving generated images (e.g., image_at_epoch_0001.png).


View Output:
Check generated images in the Colab "Files" tab or save to Google Drive.
Losses for the Generator and Discriminator are printed per epoch.


Push to GitHub:
Save files (e.g., images, code) to a folder, e.g., /content/drive/MyDrive/gan_project.
In a Colab cell, commit and push:%cd /content/your-repo-name
!cp /content/image_at_epoch_*.png .
!git add .
!git commit -m "Add GAN code and generated images from Colab"
!git push origin main


Note: You may need a personal access token for GitHub. Generate one at GitHub Settings and use it in the push command if prompted.



Project Structure

main.py: Main script to load data, define models, and train the GAN.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries (optional for Colab).
image_at_epoch_*.png: Generated images saved during training.

How It Works

Data Preprocessing:
Loads MNIST dataset, reshapes images to 784D vectors, and normalizes to [-1, 1].
Batches data (batch size: 256) and shuffles for training.


Generator:
Input: 100D random noise vector.
Layers: Dense(256) → LeakyReLU → Dense(512) → LeakyReLU → Dense(784, tanh).
Output: Fake 28x28 image.


Discriminator:
Input: 784D vector (real or fake image).
Layers: Dense(512) → LeakyReLU → Dense(256) → LeakyReLU → Dense(1, sigmoid).
Output: Probability of image being real.


Training:
Uses Adam optimizers (learning rate: 0.0001).
Discriminator learns to identify real vs. fake images.
Generator improves by fooling the Discriminator.


Results: Images improve over epochs, resembling MNIST digits.

Notes

Colab GPU: Enable GPU for faster training: Go to "Runtime" → "Change runtime type" → Select "GPU".
Stability: GANs can be tricky. Adjust learning rates, layer sizes, or epochs in the code if results are poor.
Storage: Images are saved in Colab’s temporary storage. Move to Google Drive or download them to persist.

Requirements
Colab includes most libraries, but verify:

tensorflow>=2.0
numpy
matplotlib
